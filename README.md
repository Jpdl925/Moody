// Part 2: Frontend Development with React & TypeScript
Objective:
To build the user interface and user experience based on the Figma design using React with TypeScript.

Instructions:
Setting Up Your Project:

React with TypeScript: Use create-react-app or Vite to bootstrap your project with TypeScript enabled.
Routing: Implement routing using React Router to navigate between different pages of your app.
State Management: Use React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage local component state. For global state management, you can use useContext or third-party libraries like Zustand or Redux.
UI Library: Choose one of the following UI libraries to style your app:
Chakra UI: For a modular and accessible design system.
Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling.
Bootstrap: For a classic and responsive UI.
Component Design: Implement reusable components based on your Figma design (e.g., buttons, forms, cards).
Features to Implement:

Authentication: Create a login/signup page and handle authentication.
CRUD Functionality: Allow the user to create, read, update, and delete items in your app. For example, if youâ€™re building a task manager, implement task management features.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive across different screen sizes.
Form Handling: Use React's form handling techniques to validate input fields and provide user feedback.
API Integration: Use fetch or axios to make HTTP requests to the backend you will develop in Part 3.
Submission:

Your front-end code should be pushed to GitHub.
Submit the GitHub repository link and a live demo of your front-end (using services like Vercel or Netlify).
